# Assembler

This is the Final project in Laboratory C 20465 course at the Open University. It's a comprehensive assembler program for a specific assembly language, written in C. The purpose is to simulate the operation of common system programs, and thus experience writing a large-scale software project.
___

## ðŸ§© Project Structure

The project consists of multiple C and header files, each serving a specific purpose in the program. It adheres to principles of clarity, readability, structured writing, and data abstraction.

The assembler works in three main stages:

1. **Pre-Processing**
2. **First Pass**
3. **Second Pass**

These stages form the core algorithm of the assembler.

### Pre-Processing

The pre-assembler reads the source file line by line and identifies macro definitions. If a macro is identified, the lines of the macro are added to a macro table and replaced in the source file.

### First Pass

The first pass identifies symbols (labels) and assigns them numerical values representing their corresponding memory addresses.

### Second Pass

In the second pass, the assembler generates the final machine code, replacing operation names with their binary equivalents and symbol names with their assigned memory locations.
___ 

## ðŸ”§ Usage

Run the compiled program using the following command: `./assembler file_name_1 ... file_name_N`

This will output machine code generated from the provided assembly file.
